The Indiana University Math Club, is designed to be a place for students
Internetested in mathematics to discuss, learn and become involved in mathematics. We meet
weekly, at 6:30pm on Wednesday in Rawles Hall 107 (free pizza!). Usually, we have a speaker, but
sometimes we either play (mathematical) games, or do other math related activities.
If you are interested in the math club, or if you are interested in becoming a math
major, feel free to stop by!
