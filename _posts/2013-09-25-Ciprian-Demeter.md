In this talk, Prof. Ciprian Demeter will talk about finding arithmetic
progressions of prime numbers. More specifically, he  briefly explore 
the progress of (mathematical) technology over the last
100 years or so that has led to the recent proof that the prime numbers
contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions.
