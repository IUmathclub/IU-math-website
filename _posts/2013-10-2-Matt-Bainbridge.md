In this talk, Prof. Matt Bainbridge will talk about the *Poncelet's
Porism*. More specifically, suppose E and F are ellipses in the plane with
E inside F. Poncelet's Porism says that if there is a single polygon which
is inscribed in F and circumscribed around E, then there are infinitely
many such polygons.  In this talk, I'll give a beautiful proof of this
theorem using some basic (but deep) properties of elliptic curves.
